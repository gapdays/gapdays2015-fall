The first week of the 3rd GAP Days is a school on representation
theory of algebras and homological algebra in GAP. The talks
will provide a general introduction to programming in GAP,
QPA (Quiver and Path Algebras), and homalg/CAP
(homological algebra and category theory in GAP).

The school will be followed by a coding sprint to mutally integrate
the QPA and homalg/CAP. It will end on Wednesday the 23rd at 13:00.
